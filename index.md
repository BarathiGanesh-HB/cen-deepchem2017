### About DeepChem 2017

The AIBio (Artificial Intelligence for Biology) group in the Computational Engineering and Networking (CEN) department at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is organizing a three-day workshop on 22-24th December, 2017. The workshop will cover Deep learning and Natural language processing (NLP) towards the applications in the field of Computational Chemistry, Biology & Nano-materials. The main aim of this workshop is to share the ideas of on-going research and exploratory topics, leading to possible collaborations between CEN faculty, Ph.D research scholars and students.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in deep learning, Computational chemistry,Biology & Nano-materials, from academia and industry. The primary target audience of the workshop is Mtech students, research scholars and faculty. We hope to have an interactive session, with a free exchange of ideas, views and comments. Please fill all the required details during registration. For more queries, please contact **barathiganesh.hb[at]gmail.com**, **vinayakumarr77[at]gmail.com**.

**MinION** A device for real-time biological analyses. Nanopore devices executes DNA/RNA sequencing directly and in real time. Availability of low cost DNA sequencers like Oxford Nanopore sequencers and machine learning are going to revolutionize biology and healthcare. There will be heavy demand for people knowledgeable in computational biology.
